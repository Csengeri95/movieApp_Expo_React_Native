# movieApp

This is an Expo React Native portfolio app, similar to Apple TV or HBO Max. On the main page, a SectionList lists the series and movies. At the top of the screen is a video I've edited, which when scrolled, performs a fade effect and displays the headbar. 
At the bottom of the page are the tab navigators, which highlight the current screen in red. Clicking on some content will display the item, at the top of the screen there is the poster (with the same effect), and moving down the screen will display the characters, story and further information, according to the type of item. 
On the screen you can watch the trailer of the item, share it, or if the release date is later, add it to the calendar as an event. 
The second screen is Search, where you can search the database by entering an actor, title or year. The application will display suggestions or highlight matching letters.
I created the database using Node.js.
